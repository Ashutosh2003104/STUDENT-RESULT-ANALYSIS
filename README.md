# STUDENT-RESULT-ANALYSIS
I created a Python project for student result analysis, enabling users to input student scores and calculate averages, grades, and performance metrics. The program visualizes data with graphs and provides insights like top scorers and pass rates, making academic evaluation efficient and insightful.
